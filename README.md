This repository contains some content intended to help users become familiar with some of the capabilities of the idun-cartridge. There are 5 sub-directories.

- _apps/_ contains some Lua sample applications. Run them from the idun-shell by simply typing the name, such as `cube.app`. Most can be exited with the STOP key to return to the shell. Some have a popup menu, which is activated using `C= + ‚üµ`.
- _demos/_ contains two single-file .prg demos for C64 mode and one .d64 image of the C128 VDC graphics demo "Risen from Oblivion".
	+ For the C64 demos, first `cd` to this directory in idun-shell, then enter C64 mode with the `go64` command. From the C64 basic prompt, use `RUN"<filename>.prg"` to load and run the demos.
	+ For the C128 VDC demo, first use the `mount` command to attach the .d64 image to device D. Then, `reboot` to return to C128 BASIC, and map device D: to unit 10 (the default). Use `run"risen*",u10` to start the demo.
- _games/_ contains several C128 games, a Galaga port for C64 mode, "shareware" version of PETSCII Robots 128, and two interactive fiction titles for playing in `frotz`.
	+ Start `galaga` or `galaga-usb` from C64 mode similar to the C64 demos.
	+ Mount `Robots-128.d71` on `D:` and select `D:` as the idun device. Press `F5` in BASIC to launch the game booter. Use your already configured USB gamepad to control the game.
	+ Mount the disk images for the C128 games and use either `load` from idun-shell or `run` from the basic prompt to start them.
	+ `frotz` is a Linux program that is *not installed by default*. You can add it from the Linux shell with `sudo pacman -S frotz-ncurses`. Then, also from the Linux shell, start the game with a command like `frotz <z-file-name>`.
- _pics/_ contains many pics viewable using the VDC/80-column output
	+ Use the `showvdc` command in the idun-shell to display images in the mono/ and vdc-color/ directories. _Note:_ most images are hi-res and will require 64kB VRAM.
	+ Use the `showzx` command in the idun-shell to display images in the spectrum/ directory. These are low-res and will work with 16kB VRAM.
	+ `ansilove.ans` is a color ANSI graphic useful for testing. Use `mode ans` to load ANSI character set, then `linux "cat ansilove.ans"` to display the file in the tty.
- _sids/_ contains 50+ SID music files that can be played from the idun-shell using the `sidplay` command.
